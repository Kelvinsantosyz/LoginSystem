# Login Page - Django Application

This is a simple login page built using Django, a Python web framework. It allows users to sign in or sign up for an account.

## Features

- Users can sign in with their email and password.
- Users can sign up by providing their email, phone number, and password.
- Error messages are displayed if there are any issues with the login or signup process.
- Social media icons (Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIn) are displayed as links.

## Technologies Used

- Django: a high-level Python web framework used for handling the backend logic and rendering dynamic content.
- HTML: the markup language used for structuring the page.
- CSS: used for styling the page and elements.
- JavaScript: provides interactivity by manipulating the form display.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Django if you haven't already (`pip install django`).
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
4. Run the Django development server (`python manage.py runserver`).
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to access the login page.

## Files and Directories

- `static/css/style.css`: contains the CSS styles for the login page.
- `static/js/transition.js`: contains the JavaScript code for handling form transitions.
- `templates/login.html`: the main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the login page.
- `views.py`: contains the Django views that handle the login and signup processes.

## Dependencies

- Django 3.x or later
- Font Awesome (included via CDN)

## Notes

- This is a basic implementation of a login page and may not include all the necessary security features for a production-ready application. Additional security measures, such as encryption, should be implemented.
- The social media links in the code are currently pointing to placeholder URLs and should be updated with the appropriate links.
